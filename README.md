# drupal-7-module-iform_mobile_auth

The Mobile Authentication module was created to allow applications on mobile devices to communicate with the web-site 
that hosts the module and so indirectly with the warehouse. 

For more information, see the 
[Mobile Authentication Module documentation](http://indicia-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/site-building/iform/modules/mobile-auth/intro.html).
